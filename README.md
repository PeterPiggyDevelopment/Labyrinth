# Labyrinth
## Introduction 
This is a **Kirill Yarcev**'s System Programming Languages project. It writen only to pass the exam. No politics, no snots, no 
quotes, no long reflections. 

## Overview
This project is consists of two parts. The first part is a client which generates random labyrinth and sends it to the server. 

The second part as you may guess is a server. It is deciphers the string which has been generated by client and passes the 
labyrinth. After that server sends labyrinth back to the client.

Client writes labyrinth to the console.
